To identify this effect, we use a reform of the French stock market that raises the relative cost of speculative trading for retail investors. The daily return volatility of the stocks affected by the reform falls by 20 basis points (a quarter of the sample standard deviation of the return volatility) relative to other stocks. For affected stocks, we also ﬁnd a signiﬁcant decrease in the magnitude of return reversals and the price impact of trades.},

Finer sorts confirm the results, as do sorts by firm size and institutional ownership level. Younger and more attentive individuals are more likely to be contrarian, and a firm’s dividend yield, leverage, size, book to market, and analyst coverage are associated with the fraction of contrarian trades they face around earnings announcements.

Following the reform, P\&Is reduced their longest maturity bond holdings but increased those with 20-year maturities, steepening the long end of the yield curve.

            We decompose corporate bond and equity index returns into duration-matched government bond returns and the excess returns over this duration-matched counterfactual, which we term duration-adjusted returns. Compared with previously used excess return definitions (ie, returns in excess of Treasury bills), our decomposition leads to markedly different return patterns and asset pricing implications. In particular, we find that investment-grade bonds earn a small credit risk premium, comparable in magnitude to the convenience yield, and that duration adjustment resolves the CAPM’s failure to price corporate bonds. These findings highlight the importance of adjusting for nonstationary interest rate environments in asset pricing tests.},

Shocks to the short rate are transmitted to long rates through arbitrageurs’ carry trades. Arbitrageurs earn rents from transmitting the shocks through bond risk premia that relate positively to the slope of the term structure. When the short rate is the only risk factor, changes in investor demand have the same relative effect on interest rates across maturities regardless of the maturities where they originate. When investor demand is also stochastic, demand effects become more localized. A calibration indicates that long rates underreact to forward-guidance announcements about short rates. Largescale asset purchases can be more effective in moving long rates, especially if they are concentrated at long maturities.},

While market orders have a larger individual price impact, limit orders are far more numerous. This results in price discovery occurring predominantly through limit orders. HFTs submit the bulk of limit orders and these limit orders provide most of the price discovery. Submissions of limit orders and their contribution to price discovery fall with volatility due to changes in HFTs’ behavior. Consistent with adverse selection arising from faster reactions to public information, HFTs’ informational advantage is partially explained by public information.},

This effect increases when the fundamental value has high volatility and with asymmetric information across traders. Changes in the microstructure noise are negatively correlated with changes in the estimated fundamental value, implying that asset betas estimated from high-frequency data will be incorrect.},

Using a flexible Bayesian inference approach, we show that a sparsity-inducing prior reduces model uncertainty but leads to high-turnover, under-diversified portfolios with concentrated exposures to a few characteristics. In contrast, a prior favoring ridge-type shrinkage fosters better diversification across more characteristics, yielding portfolios more aligned with mean-variance efficiency, particularly when accounting for realistic transaction costs. Our findings caution against over-reliance on sparsity-inducing methods when predicting the cross-section of stock returns using firm characteristics.},

We further show that higher ambiguity leads to lower engagement on social media platforms and a weaker connection between disagreement and trading volume, providing novel evidence on how ambiguity shapes market outcomes.},

In normal times, these positive eﬀects are driven by incentives, while tight obligations constrain market makers and decrease market quality. In crises, results ﬂip: voluntary activity withdraws which exacerbates liquidity dry-ups; in contrast, tight obligations force market makers to step in as providers of last resort.

We directly measure investors’ expectations using traded inflation-indexed contracts and show that, post-2000, stocks offer positive returns in response to higher expected inflation: unconditionally, a 10 basis point increase in 10-year breakeven inflation is associated with a 1.1\% increase in the value-weighted stock index. Using a wide range of approaches, we show that this positive relationship is almost entirely due to aggregate variations in expected excess returns rather than changes in firm cash flows (e.g., due to higher mark-ups) or fluctuations in risk-free rates (e.g., due to expected monetary policy response). Overall, a risk premium “proxy” mechanism appears to explain this dominant role of expected excess returns: higher long-term inflation expectations signal stronger future economic growth and reduced volatility.},

Regions facing larger tariff cuts experienced prolonged declines in formal sector employment and earnings relative to other regions. The impact of tariff changes on regional earnings 20 years after liberalization was three times the effect after 10 years. These increasing effects on regional earnings are inconsistent with conventional spatial equilibrium models, which predict declining effects due to spatial arbitrage. We investigate potential mechanisms, finding empirical support for a mechanism involving imperfect interregional labor mobility and dynamics in labor demand, driven by slow capital adjustment and agglomeration economies. This mechanism gradually amplifies the effects of liberalization, explaining the slow adjustment path of regional earnings and quantitatively accounting for the magnitude of the long-run effects.

These opposing effects are accompanied by an unprecedented gender gap in political preferences, with men becoming relatively more conservative.

We combine data on loans between Danish firms and banks with survey-based producer prices and transaction-based export unit values. Exploiting banks’ heterogeneous exposure to the global financial crisis, we show that loans to firms with relationships to exposed banks drop and lending rates increase. In response, firms raise prices by 3–5 percent. This effect is decreasing in the elasticity of firms’ demand but positive for most industrial production. Our results show that firms increase prices to raise cash when external sources of liquidity dry up. (JEL D22, E23, E31, E32, E44, G01, G21)},

To understand how turnovers affect national outcomes, we study all presidential and parliamentary elections held globally between 1946 and 2018. We document the prevalence of turnovers over time and estimate their effects on economic performance, human development, and the quality of democracy. Using a close-elections regression discontinuity design across countries, we show that turnovers improve several measures of country performance. To explain these positive effects, we explore how electoral turnovers affect leader characteristics, shape policy decisions, reduce perceived corruption, and foster accountability.},

            How should an investor value financial data? The answer is complicated because it depends on the characteristics of all investors. We develop a sufficient statistics approach that uses equilibrium asset return moments to summarize all relevant information about others’ characteristics. Our approach values public or private data, data about one or many assets, and data relevant for dividends or sentiment. While different data types, of course, have different valuations, heterogeneous investors also value the same data very differently. This finding suggests a low price elasticity for data demand. Heterogeneous investors’ data valuations are also affected very differentially by market illiquidity.},

Using micro-level data from Brazil, I exploit variation in the supply of government bonds at different maturities to estimate the causal effect of additional government debt outstanding on firm issuance decisions. I find that at early stages of development, government debt complements corporate debt, implying that additional government debt outstanding at a given maturity causes firms to issue more. These effects ultimately increase long-term debt issuance and investment across firms, with stronger responses from companies with higher asset duration. However, as markets mature and government debt levels rise, I document a shift from complementarity to substitution. This evidence can be rationalized through government debt reducing corporate pricing uncertainty by providing pricing benchmarks and facilitating price discovery in bond markets.},

Unlike more common sentiment scores used for stock return prediction (e.g., those sold by commercial vendors or built with dictionary-based methods), our supervised learning framework constructs a score that is speciﬁcally adapted to the problem of return prediction. Our method proceeds in three steps: 1) isolating a list of terms via predictive screening, 2) assigning prediction weights to these words via topic modeling, and 3) aggregating terms into an articlelevel predictive score via penalized likelihood. We derive theoretical guarantees on the accuracy of estimates from our model with minimal assumptions. In our empirical analysis, we study one of the most actively monitored streams of news articles in the ﬁnancial system—the Dow Jones Newswires—and show that our supervised text model excels at extracting return-predictive signals in this context. Information in newswires is assimilated into prices with an ineﬃcient delay that is broadly consistent with limits-to-arbitrage (i.e., more severe for smaller and more volatile ﬁrms) yet can be exploited in a real-time trading strategy with reasonable turnover and net of transaction costs.},

This paper examines the key features of sovereign retail programmes and instruments currently offered by OECD member and partner countries. It assesses the costs and benefits to issuers and analyses recent trends in retail demand for sovereign debt, based mainly on OECD survey findings. The analysis provides insights on different approaches that may help policy makers design and implement effective retail debt programmes and instruments. Authorised for release by Carmine Di Noia, Director, OECD Directorate for Financial and Enterprise Affairs.},

	title = {Can {Machines} {Learn} {Weak} {Signals}?},
	abstract = {In high-dimensional regressions with low signal-to-noise ratios, we assess the predictive performance of several prevalent machine learning methods. Theoretical insights show Ridge regression’s superiority in exploiting weak signals, surpassing a zero benchmark. In contrast, Lasso fails to exceed this baseline, indicating its learning limitations. Simulations reveal that Random Forest generally outperforms Gradient Boosted Regression Trees when signals are weak. Moreover, Neural Networks with 2-regularization excel in capturing nonlinear functions of weak signals. Our empirical analysis across six economic datasets suggests that the weakness of signals, not necessarily the absence of sparsity, may be Lasso’s major limitation in economic predictions.},

            In statistics, samples are drawn from a population in a data‐generating process (DGP). Standard errors measure the uncertainty in estimates of population parameters. In science, evidence is generated to test hypotheses in an evidence‐generating process (EGP). We claim that EGP variation across researchers adds uncertainty—nonstandard errors (NSEs). We study NSEs by letting 164 teams test the same hypotheses on the same data. NSEs turn out to be sizable, but smaller for more reproducible or higher rated research. Adding peer‐review stages reduces NSEs. We further find that this type of uncertainty is underestimated by participants.},

	abstract = {Household financial decisions are complex, interdependent, and heterogeneous, and central to the functioning of the financial system. We present an overview of the rapidly expanding literature on household finance (with some important exceptions) and suggest directions for future research. We begin with the theory and empirics of asset market participation and asset allocation over the life cycle. We then discuss household choices in insurance markets, trading behavior, decisions on retirement saving, and financial choices by retirees. We survey research on liabilities, including mortgage choice, refinancing, and default, and household behavior in unsecured credit markets, including credit cards and payday lending. We then connect the household to its social environment, including peer effects, cultural and hereditary factors, intra-household financial decision-making, financial literacy, cognition, and educational interventions. We also discuss literature on the provision and consumption of financial advice. (JEL D15, G41, G50, J26, Z13)},

We analyze several transmission mechanisms operating through direct, partial equilibrium channels—intertemporal substitution and net interest rate exposure—and indirect, general equilibrium channels—net nominal exposure, as well as wealth, collateral and labor income channels. The strength of these forces varies across households depending on their marginal propensities to consume, their balance sheet composition, the sensitivity of their own earnings to ﬂuctuations in aggregate labor income, and the responsiveness of aggregate earnings, asset prices and inﬂation to monetary policy shocks. We quantify all these channels in the euro area by combining micro data from the HFCS and the EU-LFS with structural VARs estimated on aggregate time series. We ﬁnd that the indirect labor income channel and the housing wealth effect are the strongest drivers of the aggregate consumption response to monetary policy and explain the cross-country heterogeneity in these responses.},

We show that ESG news events appear to be an important and growing component of retail investors’ portfolio allocation decisions. Yet, inconsistent with non-pecuniary preferences, our evidence shows that retail investors mainly trade on this information when they deem it financially material to a company’s stock performance. We also find their net trading demand predicts future abnormal returns in the subsample of financially material events, consistent with retail traders benefiting from incorporating ESG-related information in their decision-making when it is relevant to firm value. Overall, we conclude that the average U.S. retail investor cares about firms’ ESGrelated activities, but primarily to the extent they are financially material for company performance.},

Many studies conclude that parties do matter in the United States. Democratic presidents generate, for example, higher rates of economic growth than Republican presidents, but these studies using data for the national level do not identify causal effects. Ideology-induced policies are prevalent at the state level: Democratic governors implement somewhat more expansionary and liberal policies than Republican governors. At the local level, government ideology hardly inﬂuences economic policy-making at all.

In a validation sample, the daily Gibbs estimate achieves a correlation of 0.965 with the transactionlevel estimate. When the Gibbs estimates are incorporated into asset pricing specifications over a long historical sample (1926 to 2006), the results suggest that effective cost (as a characteristic) is positively related to stock returns. The relation is strongest in January, but it appears to be distinct from size effects.},

To establish a causal relationship between the return gap and RTP, we use an instrumental variables approach that exploits retail investors’ tendency to more actively trade stocks with low per-share prices.

Market uctuations a ect investors’ recall: positive market returns cue investors to retrieve episodes of rising markets and recall own performances more positively. Recalled experiences explain a sizable fraction of cross-investor variation in beliefs and dominate actual experiences in explanatory power.

Under Full Commitment, the government chooses a leveraged and volatile portfolio of nominal liabilities and real assets to use inﬂation to smooth taxes. With No Commitment, it reduces borrowing costs ex-ante using a stable real debt share strategically to prevent future governments from monetizing debt ex-post. Such policies rationalize the small and persistent real debt share in U.S. data, with higher TIPS shares eﬀectively curbing inﬂation.

The overall results indicate that retail investors in the corporate bond market suffer from behavioral biases but institutional investors don’t.

            How do individuals form expectations about future inflation? We propose that individuals overweight inflation experienced during their lifetimes. This approach modifies existing adaptive learning models to allow for age-dependent updating of expectations in response to inflation surprises. Young individuals update their expectations more strongly than older individuals since recent experiences account for a greater share of their accumulated lifetime history. We find support for these predictions using 57 years of microdata on inflation expectations from the Reuters/Michigan Survey of Consumers. Differences in experiences strongly predict differences in expectations, including the substantial disagreement between young and old individuals in periods of highly volatile inflation, such as the 1970s. It also explains household borrowing and lending behavior, including the choice of mortgages.},

Using individual trading data, we show that the disposition effect—the propensity to realize past gains more than past losses—applies only to nondelegated assets like individual stocks; delegated assets, like mutual funds, exhibit a robust reverse-disposition effect. In an experiment, we show that increasing investors’ cognitive dissonance results in both a larger disposition effect in stocks and a larger reverse-disposition effect in funds. Additionally, increasing the salience of delegation increases the reverse-disposition effect in funds. Cognitive dissonance provides a uniﬁed explanation for apparently contradictory investor behavior across asset classes and has implications for personal investment decisions, mutual fund management, and intermediation.},

Theoretically, a simple dynamic inventory model captures an intermediary's use of price pressure to mean-revert inventory. She trades off revenue loss due to price pressure against price risk associated with staying in a nonzero inventory state. The closed-form solution identifies the intermediary's risk aversion and the investors' private value distribution from the observed time series patterns of prices and inventories. These parameters imply a relative social cost due to price pressure, a deviation from constrained Pareto efficiency, of approximately 10\% of the cost of immediacy.},

We document short-term overnight-return persistence, consistent with existing evidence of short-term persistence in the share demand of sentiment-inﬂuenced investors. We ﬁnd that short-term persistence is stronger for harder-to-value ﬁrms, consistent with existing evidence that sentiment plays a larger role for such ﬁrms. We show that stocks with high (low) overnight returns underperform (outperform) over the longer term, consistent with prior evidence of temporary sentiment-driven mispricing. Overall, our evidence supports using overnight returns to measure ﬁrm-speciﬁc sentiment.},

Speciﬁcally, they appear to select bonds by ﬁrst screening on a credit rating and then sorting by yield, buying the highest-yielding bonds within each rating level. Because yields lead credit rating changes, selecting on yield-within-rating means that retail investors systematically trade in the opposite direction of changing fundamentals, buy in advance of credit downgrades and defaults, and materially underperform a diversiﬁed portfolio. Our study provides new evidence of ill-informed retail trading in a market that is thought to be relatively sophisticated, corroborates regulators’ concerns about investor overreliance on credit ratings, and contributes to the academic literature on the roles and consequences of credit ratings in debt markets.},

In macroeconomics, interactive effects represent unobservable common shocks and their heterogeneous impacts on cross sections.

Under both large N and large T , the estimator is shown to be NT consistent, which is valid in the presence of correlations and heteroskedasticities of unknown form in both dimensions. We also derive the constrained estimator and its limiting distribution, imposing additivity coupled with interactive effects. The problem of testing additive versus interactive effects is also studied. In addition, we consider identiﬁcation and estimation of models in the presence of a grand mean, time-invariant regressors, and common regressors. Given identiﬁcation, the rate of convergence and limiting results continue to hold.},

            We examine international equity allocations at the fund level and show how excess foreign returns influence portfolio rebalancing, capital flows, and currencies. Our equilibrium model of incomplete foreign exchange (FX) risk trading where exchange rate risk partially segments international equity markets is consistent with the observed dynamics of equity returns, exchange rates, and fund-level capital flows. We document that rebalancing is more intense under higher FX volatility and find heterogeneous rebalancing behavior across different fund characteristics. A granular instrumental variable approach identifies a positive currency supply elasticity.

            We show that mutual fund ratings generate correlated demand that creates systematic price fluctuations. Mutual fund investors chase fund performance via Morningstar ratings. Until June 2002, funds pursuing the same investment style had highly correlated ratings. Therefore, rating-chasing investors directed capital into winning styles, generating style-level price pressures, which reverted over time. In June 2002, Morningstar reformed its methodology of equalizing ratings across styles. Style-level correlated demand via mutual funds immediately became muted, significantly altering the time-series and cross-sectional variation in style returns.},

We develop a general theoretical framework and an empirical identi cation strategy, taking advantage of a new micro-level dataset for the Belgian manufacturing sector. We nd strong evidence of strategic complementarities, with a typical rm adjusting its price with an elasticity of 0.4 in response to its competitors’ price changes and with an elasticity of 0.6 in response to its own cost shocks. Furthermore, we nd evidence of substantial heterogeneity in these elasticities across rms. Small rms exhibit no strategic complementarities in price setting and complete cost pass-through. In contrast, large rms exhibit strong strategic complementarities, responding to both competitor price changes and their own cost shocks with roughly equal elasticities of around 0.5. We show that this pattern of heterogeneity in markup variability across rms is important for explaining the aggregate markup response to international shocks and the observed low exchange rate pass-through into domestic prices.},

These HANK models offer a much more accurate representation of household consumption behavior and can generate realistic distributions of income, wealth, and, albeit to a lesser degree, household balance sheets. At the same time, they can accommodate many sources of macroeconomic fluctuations, including those driven by aggregate demand. In sum, they provide a rich theoretical framework for quantitative analysis of the interaction between cross-sectional distributions and aggregate dynamics. In this article, we outline a state-of-the-art version of HANK together with its representative agent counterpart, and convey two broad messages about the role of household heterogeneity for the response of the macroeconomy to aggregate shocks: 1) the similarity between the Representative Agent New Keynesian (RANK) and HANK frameworks depends crucially on the shock being analyzed; and 2) certain important macroeconomic questions concerning economic fluctuations can only be addressed within heterogeneous agent models.},

	abstract = {I study aggregate consumption dynamics under incomplete markets, focusing on the relationship between consumption and the path for interest rates. I first provide a general aggregation result under extreme illiquidity (no borrowing and no outside assets), deriving a generalized Euler relation involving the real interest rate, current and future aggregate consumption. This provides a tractable way of incorporating incomplete markets in macroeconomic models, dealing only with aggregates. Although this relation does not necessarily coincide with the standard representative-agent Euler equation, I show that it does for an important benchmark specification. When this is the case, idiosyncratic uncertainty and incomplete markets leave their imprint by affecting the discount factor in this representation, but the sensitivity of consumption to current and future interest rates is unaffected. An immediate corollary is that “forward guidance” (lower future interest rates) is as powerful as in representative agent models. I show that the same representation holds with positive liquidity (borrowing and outside assets) when utility is logarithmic. I show that away from these benchmark cases, consumption is likely to become more sensitive to interest rate, and especially future interest rates. Finally, I apply my approach to a real business cycle economy, providing an exact analytical aggregation result that complements existing numerical results.},

Fiscal multipliers depend only on the interaction between iMPCs and public deﬁcits. We provide empirical estimates of iMPCs and argue that they are inconsistent with representative-agent, two-agent and one-asset heterogeneous-agent models, but can be matched by models with two assets. Quantitatively, models that match empirical iMPCs predict deﬁcit-ﬁnanced ﬁscal multipliers that are larger than one, even if monetary policy is active, taxation is distortionary, and investment is crowded out. These models also imply larger ampliﬁcation of shocks that involve private borrowing, as we illustrate in an application to deleveraging.},

I use it for a full-ﬂedged New Keynesian macro analysis: determinacy with interest-rate rules, solving the forward-guidance puzzle, ampliﬁcation and multipliers, and optimal monetary policy. Ampliﬁcation requires countercyclical while solving the puzzle requires procyclical inequality: a Catch-22, resolved in theory if the separate "pure" risk channel is procyclical enough. Price-level-targeting ensures determinacy and is puzzle-free, even when both inequality and risk are countercyclical, thus resolving the Catch-22. The same holds for a rule ﬁxing nominal public debt in the model version with liquidity. Optimal policy with heterogeneity features a novel inequality-stabilization motive generating higher inﬂation volatility—but it is unaffected by risk, insofar as the target equilibrium entails no inequality.},

The model yields empirically realistic distributions of wealth and marginal propensities to consume because of two features: uninsurable income shocks and multiple assets with different degrees of liquidity and different returns. In this environment, the indirect effects of an unexpected cut in interest rates, which operate through a general equilibrium increase in labor demand, far outweigh direct effects such as intertemporal substitution. This finding is in stark contrast to small- and medium-scale Representative Agent New Keynesian (RANK) economies, where the substitution channel drives virtually all of the transmission from interest rates to consumption. Failure of Ricardian equivalence implies that, in HANK models, the fiscal reaction to the monetary expansion is a key determinant of the overall size of the macroeconomic response.

Using data on portfolio stock transactions between 2016 and 2021, we show that, while all investors exhibit a significant disposition effect before 2018, i.e., a greater propensity to realize paper gains than losses, highly-advised investors see their bias significantly reduced after 2018.

The framework emphasizes sparsity, proposing methods to select a limited number of impactful factors and outperform a stricter benchmark that incorporates the Fama-French 3-factor model proposed methodology - all while avoiding look-ahead bias. Recognizing the implicit sparsity assumption in traditional models, the framework explicitly considers similar scarcity during factor selection. We apply the proposed framework to a large set of factors and various time periods, demonstrating that simple techniques can yield interesting results when applied with proper methodology. Overall, this paper provides valuable tools for researchers and practitioners, offering guidance for pricing factor selection and advocating for sparsity.},

Because the absence of trades is correlated with volume, our model predicts a testable relation between spreads and normal and unexpected volume, and demonstrates how volume affects the speed of price adjustment. Our model also demonstrateshow the transaction price series will be a biased representation of the true price process, with the variance being both overstated and heteroskedastic.},

            We exploit a discontinuity in the New York Stock Exchange Designated Market Maker (DMM) contract to identify causal effects of DMM participation on equilibrium market outcomes. We document that contractual features that enhance DMM participation are associated with increased depth, narrower bid-ask spreads, and higher rates of price improvement, with most of the improvements attributable to increases in liquidity provision on markets other than the NYSE. These results cannot be attributed to the mechanical effects of the contractual changes and support the interpretation that market making is characterized by strategic complementarity.

The switch from cash payments to electronic payments delivered via savings accounts is found to have medium-term effects on savings decisions, transaction costs, and coping strategies. Overall, the study finds that, following the intervention, a substitution effect emerged between saving portfolio choices, with the poor favouring bank accounts over informal saving arrangements. It also found that the Oportunidades savings account led to an increase in remittance reception, which in turn had important implications for household consumption smoothing and risk management decisions. The study also reveals impact heterogeneity depending on household composition and the rural-urban divide, with important implications for replicability of similar policy innovations in other countries.},

We investigate empirically the comparative influence of high and low frequency traders on the price process, and conversely the influence of the price process on the trading of high and low frequency traders. We find that high frequency traders have a particularly high success rate on each transaction, measured by the likelihood that the following price change will go in their direction as well as by the amount of time they have to wait to realize their gain, when trading against low frequency traders. Contrary to common wisdom, we find that high frequency traders’ activity does not induce volatility or jumps. In fact, it is their absence that is problematic: volatility and jumps are more prevalent in periods when they trade less intensely. Conversely, we find that spikes in volatility and jumps cause high frequency traders to trade less intensely, decreasing their provision of liquidity. Finally, looking at the market microstructure noise component to the price model, we find that higher level of noise generates trading opportunities for high frequency traders and lead them to increase their trading activity.},

This incentive induces procyclical risk-taking behavior among institutional investors, generating correlated demand shocks that amplify stocks’ market risk.

The model allows us to attribute variation in stock returns to changing stock characteristics, changing investor preferences or beliefs, and the entrance of new investors. Improved stock fundamentals are initially key, accounting for 21\% of the variance in cross-sectional stock returns during the formation of the bubble. In the expansion phase of the bubble, the entrance of new investors plays an important role, explaining 43\% of the cross-sectional variance during the phase. Finally, the deﬂation phase is characterized by shifts in preferences or beliefs among existing retail investors, accounting for 25\% of the cross-sectional variance in the period. We highlight the ways in which our structural model quantiﬁes the forces in Kindleberger (1978)’s classic narrative.},

In contrast, past smoothed intraday market returns strongly positively forecast subsequent overnight returns; this partially-oﬀsetting eﬀect explains PE’s relatively poor forecasting ability (R2 only 3\%). Our decomposition also resurrects the conditional CAPM: If we allow market betas to vary with past smoothed overnight returns, the four Fama-French factors’ alphas decrease on average by 84\%. We interpret these return patterns through a clientele perspective. First, individual investor expectations and consumption growth strongly positively forecast overnight market returns, while intermediary risk tolerance strongly negatively forecasts intraday market returns. Second, aggregate cash-ﬂow news occurs primarily intraday and is positively (negatively) correlated with revisions in expected future overnight (intraday) returns. Finally, while the Tech boom, Covid crash/rebound, and patterns in meme stocks were primarily driven by overnight returns, the Global Financial Crisis was mostly an intraday phenomenon.},

The illiquidity measure here is the average across stocks of the daily ratio of absolute stock return to dollar volume, which is easily obtained from daily stock data for long time series in most stock markets. Illiquidity aﬀects more strongly small ﬁrm stocks, thus explaining time series variations in their premiums over time. r 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

The inclusion of scale variables in the model and the presence of seasonality in the data tend to erroneously indicate a competitive market structure. Contrary to the literature, in the seasonally-adjusted model without scale variables, the H-statistics indicates that banks in general and speciﬁc subgroups are non-competitive in the market. While large banks have high market power, public banks have intermediary market power, compatible with the various kinds of political interference in their management decisions.},

The COVID-19 crisis facilitates analysis: it more directly impacted borrowers than banks, was plausibly exogenous to both, and provides a unique shock-and-recovery phenomenon for identification. We find worse terms (dark-side dominance) for most relationship borrowers early in the crisis which is reversed by better treatment during recovery. Additional analysis suggests the channel behind dark-side effects is banks imposing costs on less-bank-dependent relationship borrowers to protect the value of long-term relationships with more-bank-dependent relationship borrowers.},

Using detailed administrative data on loans and ﬁrms, we employ a diﬀerence-in-diﬀerences empirical strategy to identify the causal eﬀect of bank competition. Following M\&A episodes, spreads increase and there is persistently less lending in exposed markets. We also ﬁnd that bank competition has real eﬀects: a 1\% increase in spreads leads to a 0.2\% decline in employment. We develop a tractable model of heterogeneous ﬁrms and concentration in the banking sector. In our model, the semi-elasticity of credit to lending rates is a suﬃcient statistic for the eﬀect of concentration on credit and output. We estimate this elasticity and show that the observed eﬀects in the data and predicted by the model are consistent. Among other counterfactuals, we show that if the Brazilian lending spread were to fall to the world level, output would increase by approximately 5\%.},

Pricing errors for the typical NYSE stock have a standard deviation of 3.2 percentage points and a half-life of 6.2 weeks. These pricing errors account for 9.4\${\textbackslash}\%\$, 7.0\${\textbackslash}\%\$, and 4.5\${\textbackslash}\%\$ of the respective daily, monthly, and quarterly idiosyncratic return variances.},

O artigo analisa, a partir de um estudo exploratório e da chamada avaliação baseada na teoria do programa, as premissas teóricas dos programas Bolsa Família (2003), Auxílio Emergencial (2020) e Auxílio Brasil (2021) e suas respectivas dinâmicas de implementação. Na medida em que os programas de transferência de renda ocupam lugar central na agenda pública contemporânea, conclui-se que a avaliação de limites e avanços, tanto em sua concepção teórica como em relação aos mecanismos disparados em cada contexto, contribui para revelar evidências sobre sua efetividade no enfrentamento das desigualdades duráveis e daquelas que surgem em cenários de emergência sanitária.

Such initiatives were developed in a context of exacerbated gender, race, ethnicity and class inequalities resulting from physical and social distancing measures. The article analyzes, by means of an exploratory study and the so-called theory-driven evaluation of the program, the theoretical premises of the Brazilian Income Transfer Program (2003), Brazilian Emergency Assistance (2020) and Brazil Assistance (2021) programs, and their corresponding implementation dynamics. As cash transfer programs are given centrality in the contemporary public agenda, the conclusion is that evaluating their limits and advances - as to theoretical conception and mechanisms triggered in each context - contributes to trace evidence about their effectiveness in addressing long-term inequalities and those inequalities that arise in health emergency contexts.

            Resumen: La reciente pandemia de COVID-19 llevó a muchos países a adoptar políticas de emergencia de transferencias monetarias como una forma de contener la crisis económica y humanitaria. Dichas iniciativas se desarrollaron en un contexto de profundización de las desigualdades de género, raciales, étnicas y de clase como resultado de las medidas de aislamiento físico y social. El artículo analiza, a partir de un estudio exploratorio y de la llamada evaluación basada en la teoría del programa, los supuestos teóricos de los programas Bolsa Familia (2003), Ayuda de Emergencia (2020) y Ayuda Brasil (2021), y sus respectivas dinámicas de implementación. Dado que los programas de transferencias monetarias ocupan un lugar central en la agenda pública contemporánea, se concluye que la valoración de los límites y avances, tanto en su concepción teórica como en relación con los mecanismos desencadenados en cada contexto, ayuda a revelar evidencias sobre su efectividad para enfrentar las desigualdades duraderas y las que surgen en escenarios de emergencia sanitaria.},

            We document persistent superior trading performance among a subset of individual investors. Investors classified in the top performance decile in the first half of our sample subsequently earn risk-adjusted returns of about 6\% per year. These returns are not confined to stocks in which the investors are likely to have inside information, nor are they driven by illiquid stocks. Our results suggest that skilled individual investors exploit market inefficiencies (or perhaps conditional risk premiums) to earn abnormal profits, above and beyond any profits available from well-known strategies based on size, value, momentum, or earnings announcements.

Option trades account for nearly half of all trades in 2022, making them a vital part of retail trading. Moreover, many investors trade only options. A typical retail trade is the purchase of a one-day S\&P 500 index call held for an hour. Despite wide bid-ask spreads, retail option trades incur relatively small losses. Although options theoretically resemble lottery tickets, we ﬁnd little evidence of positive skewness in realized dollar proﬁts, contradicting gambling-driven trading. Instead, retail investors tend to trade options to aﬀordably participate in high-priced underlyings and to obtain leverage. Overall, we oﬀer the ﬁrst thorough trader-level analysis of current retail option trading.},

	abstract = {Easley et al. [1996. Journal of Finance 51, 1405–1436] have proposed an empirical methodology to estimate the probability of informed trading (PIN). This approach has been employed in a wide range of applications in market microstructure, corporate ﬁnance, and asset pricing. To estimate the model, a researcher only needs the number of buyer- and seller-initiated trades. This information, however, is generally unobservable and has to be inferred from trade-classiﬁcation algorithms, which are known to be inaccurate. In this paper, we show analytically that inaccurate trade classiﬁcation leads to downward-biased PIN estimates and that the magnitude of the bias is related to a security’s trading intensity. Simulation results and empirical evidence based on order and transaction data from the New York Stock Exchange are consistent with this argument. We propose a data-based adjustment procedure that substantially reduces the misclassiﬁcation bias.},

We obtain two sets of PIN estimates by using the factorized likelihood functions in both Easley, Hvidkjaer, and O’Hara (EHO, 2010) and Lin and Ke (LK, 2011), respectively. We ﬁnd that the estimate based on the EHO factorization is systematically smaller than the estimate based on the LK factorization, meaning that there is a downward bias associated with the EHO factorization. In addition, we ﬁnd that boundary solutions appear with a very high frequency when the LK factorization is used. Thus it is necessary to use the LK factorization together with the algorithm in this paper. At last, we document several interesting empirical properties of PIN.},

This information in turn helps guide decisions in the real side of the economy. The literature on the “feedback effect” of ﬁnancial markets explores this channel. Empirical work tries to identify the informational feedback from markets to corporate decisions. Theoretical work explores implications that this feedback effect has for the equilibrium in ﬁnancial markets and for economic efﬁciency. Current trends in information technology under the FinTech revolution change the nature of information processing in ﬁnancial markets and so may change the nature of the feedback effect.

@article{giglio_test_nodate,
	title = {Test {Assets} and {Weak} {Factors}},
	abstract = {Estimation and testing of factor models in asset pricing requires choosing a set of test assets. The choice of test assets determines how well different factor risk premia can be identified: if only few assets are exposed to a factor, that factor is weak, which makes standard estimation and inference incorrect. In other words, the strength of a factor is not an inherent property of the factor: it is a property of the cross-section used in the analysis. We propose a novel way to select assets from a universe of test assets and estimate the risk premium of a factor of interest, as well as the entire stochastic discount factor, that explicitly accounts for weak factors and test assets with highly correlated risk exposures. We refer to our methodology as supervised principal component analysis (SPCA), because it iterates an asset selection step and a principal-component estimation step. We provide the asymptotic properties of our estimator, and compare its limiting behavior with that of alternative estimators proposed in the recent literature, which rely on PCA, Ridge, Lasso, and Partial Least Squares (PLS). We find that the SPCA is superior in the presence of weak factors, both in theory and in finite samples. We illustrate the use of SPCA by applying it to estimate the risk premia of several tradable and nontradable factors, to evaluate asset managers’ performance, and to de-noise asset pricing factors.},

Nevertheless, the theoretical justiﬁcation of this approach often relies on a convenient and critical assumption that factors are pervasive. To incorporate information from weaker factors, we propose a new prediction procedure based on supervised PCA, which iterates over selection, PCA, and projection. The selection step ﬁnds a subset of predictors most correlated with the prediction target, whereas the projection step permits multiple weak factors of distinct strength. We justify our procedure in an asymptotic scheme where both the sample size and the cross-sectional dimension increase at potentially diﬀerent rates. Our empirical analysis highlights the role of weak factors in predicting inﬂation, industrial production growth, and changes in unemployment.},

The empirical result shows that the causal relationship for both symmetric and asymmetric, between traditional financial markets and cryptocurrency is cyclical and only significant in the short term; such a result is robust with the examination of the VAR-based Granger causality test in the presence of instabilities. The pandemic does not influence the causal relationship, and the gold price had the most significant causal impact on cryptocurrency portfolio returns, while the fluctuations in the stock market had a negligible influence and the two indices did not have different causal impacts on the different types of cryptocurrencies.

This change follows the monetary policy tightening implemented by the Fed in the spring of 2004, which resulted in an adverse shock to the large portfolio of loans New Century was holding for investment. New Century reacted to this shock by massively resorting to deferred amortization loan contracts (“interest-only” loans). We show that these loans were not only riskier, but also that their returns were by design more sensitive to real estate prices than standard contracts. New Century was thus ﬁnancing projects with a high beta on its own survival, as predicted by a standard model of portfolio selection in ﬁnancial distress. Our ﬁndings contribute to better characterizing the type of risk taken by ﬁnancially distressed ﬁrms.

The data allow us to address selection bias concerns and to separately examine aggressive (market) and passive (limit) orders. Both aggressive and passive net buying positively predict ﬁrms’ monthly stock returns with no evidence of return reversal. Only aggressive orders correctly predict ﬁrm news, including earnings surprises, suggesting they convey novel cash ﬂow information. Only passive net buying follows negative returns, consistent with traders providing liquidity and beneﬁting from the reversal of transitory price movements.

Our empirical analysis of price behavior for two samples of ﬁrms (50 B stocks and 50 A stocks) for two different calendar dates (1996 and 1998) indicates that introduction of the closing calls has lowered execution costs for individual participants and sharpened price discovery for the broad market.

Second, arbitrage—defined as trading by fully rational investors not subject to such sentiment—is risky and therefore limited. The two assumptions together imply that changes in investor sentiment are not fully countered by arbitrageurs and so affect security returns.

	abstract = {Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) represent one of the most important financial innovations in decades. An ETF is an investment vehicle, with a specific architecture that typically seeks to track the performance of a specific index. The first US-listed ETF, the SPDR, was launched by State Street in January 1993 and seeks to track the S\&P 500 index. It is still today the largest ETF by far, with assets of \$178 billion. Following the introduction of the SPDR, new ETFs were launched tracking broad domestic and international indices, and more specialized sector, region, or country indexes. In recent years, ETFs have grown substantially in assets, diversity, and market significance, including substantial increases in assets in bond ETFs and so-called “smart beta” funds that track certain investment strategies often used by actively traded mutual funds and hedge funds. In this paper, we begin by describing the structure and organization of exchange-traded funds, contrasting them with mutual funds, which are close relatives of exchange-traded funds, describing the differences in how ETFs operate and their potential advantages in terms of liquidity, lower expenses, tax efficiency, and transparency. We then turn to concerns over whether the rise in ETFs may raise unexpected risks for investors or greater instability in financial markets. While concerns over financial fragility are worth serious consideration, some of the common concerns are overstated, and for others, a number of rules and practices are already in place that offer a substantial margin of safety.},

We also show how microeconomic parameters are mapped to these reduced-form general equilibrium elasticities. In this sense, we extend the foundational theorem of Hulten (1978) beyond the ﬁrst order to capture nonlinearities. Key features ignored by ﬁrst-order approximations that play a crucial role are: structural microeconomic elasticities of substitution, network linkages, structural microeconomic returns to scale, and the extent of factor reallocation. In a business-cycle calibration with sectoral shocks, nonlinearities magnify negative shocks and attenuate positive shocks, resulting in an aggregate output distribution that is asymmetric (negative skewness), fattailed (excess kurtosis), and has a negative mean, even when shocks are symmetric and thin-tailed. Average output losses due to short-run sectoral shocks are an order of magnitude larger than the welfare cost of business cycles calculated by Lucas (1987). Nonlinearities can also cause shocks to critical sectors to have disproportionate macroeconomic effects, almost tripling the estimated impact of the 1970s oil shocks on world aggregate output. Finally, in a long-run growth context, nonlinearities, which underpin Baumol’s cost disease via the increase over time in the sales shares of low-growth bottleneck sectors, account for a 20 percentage point reduction in aggregate TFP growth over the period 1948–2014 in the United States.},

Our main results provide a characterization of this relationship in terms of the importance of different sectors as suppliers to their immediate customers, as well as their role as indirect suppliers to chains of downstream sectors. Such higher-order interconnections capture the possibility of “cascade effects” whereby productivity shocks to a sector propagate not only to its immediate downstream customers, but also to the rest of the economy. Our results highlight that sizable aggregate volatility is obtained from sectoral idiosyncratic shocks only if there exists signiﬁcant asymmetry in the roles that sectors play as suppliers to others, and that the “sparseness” of the input–output matrix is unrelated to the nature of aggregate ﬂuctuations.},

            This paper shows that short debt maturities commit equityholders to leverage reductions when refinancing expiring debt in low-profitability states. However, shorter maturities lead to higher transaction costs since larger amounts of expiring debt need to be refinanced. We show that this trade-off between higher expected transaction costs against the commitment to reduce leverage in low-profitability states motivates an optimal maturity structure of corporate debt. Since firms with high costs of financial distress and risky cash flows benefit most from committing to leverage reductions, they have a stronger motive to issue short-term debt. Evidence supports the model’s predictions.},

            This article develops a model of optimal government debt maturity in which the government cannot issue state-contingent bonds and cannot commit to fiscal policy. If the government can perfectly commit, it fully insulates the economy against government spending shocks by purchasing short-term assets and issuing long-term debt. These positions are quantitatively very large relative to GDP and do not need to be actively managed by the government. Our main result is that these conclusions are not robust to the introduction of lack of commitment. Under lack of commitment, large and tilted debt positions are very expensive to finance ex ante since they exacerbate the problem of lack of commitment ex post. In contrast, a flat maturity structure minimizes the cost of lack of commitment, though it also limits insurance and increases the volatility of fiscal policy distortions. We show that the optimal time-consistent maturity structure is nearly flat because reducing average borrowing costs is quantitatively more important for welfare than reducing fiscal policy volatility. Thus, under lack of commitment, the government actively manages its debt positions and can approximate optimal policy by confining its debt instruments to consols.},

            Municipal bonds exhibit considerable retail pricing variation, even for same‐size trades of the same bond on the same day, and even from the same dealer. Markups vary widely across dealers. Trading strongly clusters on eighth price increments, and clustered trades exhibit higher markups. Yields are often lowered to just above salient numbers. Machine learning estimates exploiting the richness of the data show that dealers that use strategic pricing have systematically higher markups. Recent Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board rules have had only a limited impact on markups. While a subset of dealers focus on best execution, many dealers appear focused on opportunistic pricing.},

Standard event study analysis shows no significant adjustment in trading ahead of scheduled macro news announcements and trading contrary to the announcement surprise after the event. A panel regression analysis shows that the contrarian trading behavior is mostly driven by lagged returns rather than fundamental macro news. Further intraday time series analysis shows that the lagged overall news sentiment also significantly affects investor net order flow. Finally, we show that simple cross-over trading strategies that exploit retail investor order flow imbalance are profitable. Overall our results suggest that retail investors in currency markets follow the news and are influenced by news sentiment and past returns, but do not possess the skills to extract fundamental information from public news. Their trading behavior contributes to the slowdown of the price discovery process. Our findings support the differential abilities of market participants to interpret public information as an explanation for the importance of order flow in price formation in currency markets.},

            We use stock exchange message data to quantify the negative aspect of high-frequency trading, known as “latency arbitrage.” The key difference between message data and widely familiar limit order book data is that message data contain attempts to trade or cancel that fail. This allows the researcher to observe both winners and losers in a race, whereas in limit order book data you cannot see the losers, so you cannot directly see the races. We find that latency arbitrage races are very frequent (about one per minute per symbol for FTSE 100 stocks), extremely fast (the modal race lasts 5–10 millionths of a second), and account for a remarkably large portion of overall trading volume (about 20\%). Race participation is concentrated, with the top six firms accounting for over 80\% of all race wins and losses. The average race is worth just a small amount (about half a price tick), but because of the large volumes the stakes add up. Our main estimates suggest that races constitute roughly one-third of price impact and the effective spread (key microstructure measures of the cost of liquidity), that latency arbitrage imposes a roughly 0.5 basis point tax on trading, that market designs that eliminate latency arbitrage would reduce the market’s cost of liquidity by 17\%, and that the total sums at stake are on the order of \$5 billion per year in global equity markets alone.},

            Many studies use shift-share (or “Bartik”) instruments, which average a set of shocks with exposure share weights. We provide a new econometric framework for shift-share instrumental variable (SSIV) regressions in which identification follows from the quasi-random assignment of shocks, while exposure shares are allowed to be endogenous. The framework is motivated by an equivalence result: the orthogonality between a shift-share instrument and an unobserved residual can be represented as the orthogonality between the underlying shocks and a shock-level unobservable. SSIV regression coefficients can similarly be obtained from an equivalent shock-level regression, motivating shock-level conditions for their consistency. We discuss and illustrate several practical insights of this framework in the setting of Autor et al.

            We estimate how households trade off immediate costs and uncertain future benefits that occur in the very long run, 100 or more years away. We exploit a unique feature of housing markets in the United Kingdom and Singapore, where residential property ownership takes the form of either leaseholds or freeholds. Leaseholds are temporary, prepaid, and tradable ownership contracts with maturities between 99 and 999 years, while freeholds are perpetual ownership contracts. The price difference between leaseholds and freeholds reflects the present value of perpetual rental income starting at leasehold expiration, and is thus informative about very long-run discount rates. We estimate the price discounts for varying leasehold maturities compared to freeholds and extremely long-run leaseholds via hedonic regressions using proprietary data sets of the universe of transactions in each country. Households discount very long-run cash flows at low rates, assigning high present value to cash flows hundreds of years in the future. For example, 100-year leaseholds are valued at more than 10\% less than otherwise identical freeholds, implying discount rates below 2.6\% for 100-year claims.},

            We document a form of excess volatility that is difficult to reconcile with standard models of prices, even after accounting for variation in discount rates. We compare prices of claims on the same cash flow stream but with different maturities. Standard models impose precise internal consistency conditions on the joint behavior of long- and short-maturity claims and these are strongly rejected in the data. In particular, long-maturity prices are significantly more variable than justified by the behavior at short maturities. We reject internal consistency conditions in all term structures that we study, including equity options, currency options, credit default swaps, commodity futures, variance swaps, and inflation swaps.},

In addition, we find that retail investors generally trade more on bad weather days. This result is consistent with the notion that retail investors incur an opportunity cost for spending time trading on days with good weather.},

            We provide evidence that financial market risk perceptions are important drivers of economic fluctuations. We introduce a novel measure of risk perceptions: the price of volatile stocks (PVSt), defined as the book-to-market ratio of low-volatility stocks minus the book-to-market ratio of high-volatility stocks. PVSt is high when perceived risk directly measured from surveys and option prices is low. Using our measure, we show that high perceived risk is associated with low risk-free interest rates, a high cost of capital for risky firms, and future declines in output and real investment. Perceived risk as measured by PVSt falls after positive macroeconomic news. These declines are predictably followed by upward revisions in perceived risk, indicating that fluctuations in investor risk perceptions are not fully rational.},

            We examine how owning a good affects learning and beliefs about its quality. We show that people have more extreme reactions to information about a good they own compared with the same information about a nonowned good: ownership causes more optimistic beliefs after receiving a positive signal and more pessimistic beliefs after receiving a negative signal. Comparing learning to normative benchmarks reveals that people overextrapolate from signals about goods they own, which leads to an overreaction to information; in contrast, learning is close to Bayesian for nonowned goods. We provide direct evidence that this effect is driven by ownership channeling greater attention toward associated information, which leads people to overweight recent signals when forming beliefs. The relationship between ownership and beliefs has testable implications for trade and market expectations. In line with these predictions, we show that the endowment effect doubles in response to positive information and disappears with negative information, and demonstrate a significant relationship between ownership and overextrapolation in survey data about stock market expectations.},

            Long-term nominal interest rates are surprisingly sensitive to high-frequency (daily or monthly) movements in short-term rates. Since 2000, this high-frequency sensitivity has grown even stronger in U.S. data. By contrast, the association between low-frequency changes (at 6- or 12-month horizons) in long- and short-term rates, which was also strong before 2000, has weakened substantially. This puzzling post-2000 pattern arises because increases in short rates temporarily raise the term premium component of long-term yields, leading long rates to temporarily overreact to changes in short rates. The frequency-dependent excess sensitivity of long-term rates that we observe in recent years is best understood using a model in which (i) declines in short rates trigger “rate-amplifying” shifts in investor demand for long-term bonds, and (ii) the arbitrage response to these demand shifts is both limited and slow. We study, theoretically and empirically, how such rate-amplifying demand can be traced to mortgage-refinancing activity, investors who extrapolate recent changes in short rates, and investors who “reach for yield” when short rates fall. We discuss the implications of our findings for the validity of event study methodologies and the transmission of monetary policy.},

            This article studies external sovereign bonds as an asset class. We compile a new database of 266,000 monthly prices of foreign-currency government bonds traded in London and New York between 1815 (the Battle of Waterloo) and 2016, covering up to 91 countries. Our main insight is that, as in equity markets, the returns on external sovereign bonds have been sufficiently high to compensate for risk. Real ex post returns average more than 6\% annually across two centuries, including default episodes, major wars, and global crises. This represents an excess return of 3\%–4\% above US or UK government bonds, which is comparable to stocks and outperforms corporate bonds. Central to this finding are the high average coupons offered on external sovereign bonds. The observed returns are hard to reconcile with canonical theoretical models and the degree of credit risk in this market, as measured by historical default and recovery rates. Based on our archive of more than 300 sovereign debt restructurings since 1815, we show that full repudiation is rare; the median creditor loss (haircut) is below 50\%.},

The idiosyncratic movements of the largest 100 ﬁrms in the United States appear to explain about one-third of variations in output growth. This “granular” hypothesis suggests new directions for macroeconomic research, in particular that macroeconomic questions can be clariﬁed by looking at the behavior of large ﬁrms.

This paper studies the (potential) weak identiﬁcation of the NKPC under Generalized Method of Moments and traces this syndrome to a lack of higher-order dynamics in exogenous variables. We employ analytic methods to understand the economics of the NKPC identiﬁcation problem in the canonical three-equation, new Keynesian model. We revisit the empirical evidence for the USA, the UK, and Canada by constructing tests and conﬁdence intervals based on the Anderson and Rubin (1949) statistic, which is robust to weak identiﬁcation. We also apply the Guggenberger and Smith (2008) LM test to the underlying NKPC pricing parameters. Both tests yield little evidence of forward-looking inﬂation dynamics.

            We estimate the slope of the Phillips curve in the cross section of U.S. states using newly constructed state-level price indices for nontradeable goods back to 1978. Our estimates indicate that the slope of the Phillips curve is small and was small even during the early 1980s. We estimate only a modest decline in the slope of the Phillips curve since the 1980s. We use a multiregion model to infer the slope of the aggregate Phillips curve from our regional estimates. Applying our estimates to recent unemployment dynamics yields essentially no missing disinflation or missing reinflation over the past few business cycles. Our results imply that the sharp drop in core inflation in the early 1980s was mostly due to shifting expectations about long-run monetary policy as opposed to a steep Phillips curve, and the greater stability of inflation between 1990 and 2020 is mostly due to long-run inflation expectations becoming more firmly anchored.},

Our discussion highlights the different ways that the DiD literature has advanced beyond the canonical model, and helps to clarify when each of the papers will be relevant for empirical work.

We show that a family of causal effect parameters are identified in staggered DiD setups, even if differences in observed characteristics create non-parallel outcome dynamics between groups.

We also propose different aggregation schemes that can be used to highlight treatment effect heterogeneity across different dimensions as well as to summarize the overall effect of participating in the treatment. We establish the asymptotic properties of the proposed estimators and prove the validity of a computationally convenient bootstrap procedure to conduct asymptotically valid simultaneous (instead of pointwise) inference.

We also derive the semiparametric efficiency bound for the ATT in DID designs when either panel or repeated cross-section data are available, and show that our proposed estimators attain the semiparametric efficiency bound when the working models are correctly specified. Furthermore, we quantify the potential efficiency gains of having access to panel data instead of repeated cross-section data. Finally, by paying particular attention to the estimation method used to estimate the nuisance parameters, we show that one can sometimes construct doubly robust DID estimators for the ATT that are also doubly robust for inference.

            Communities across the United States are reconsidering the public safety benefits of prosecuting nonviolent misdemeanor offenses, yet there is little empirical evidence to inform policy in this area. We report the first estimates of the causal effects of misdemeanor prosecution on defendants’ subsequent criminal justice involvement. We leverage the as-if random assignment of nonviolent misdemeanor cases to assistant district attorneys (ADAs) who decide whether a case should be prosecuted in the Suffolk County District Attorney’s Office in Massachusetts. These ADAs vary in the average leniency of their prosecution decisions. We find that for the marginal defendant, nonprosecution of a nonviolent misdemeanor offense leads to a 53\% reduction in the likelihood of a new criminal complaint and a 60\% reduction in the number of new criminal complaints over the next two years. These local average treatment effects are largest for defendants without prior criminal records, suggesting that averting criminal record acquisition is an important mechanism driving our findings. We also present evidence that a recent policy change in Suffolk County imposing a presumption of nonprosecution for nonviolent misdemeanor offenses had similar beneficial effects, decreasing the likelihood of subsequent criminal justice involvement.},

We establish the nonasymptotic bounds for these deep nets for a general class of nonparametric regression-type loss functions, which includes as special cases least squares, logistic regression, and other generalized linear models. We then apply our theory to develop semiparametric inference, focusing on causal parameters for concreteness, and demonstrate the effectiveness of deep learning with an empirical application to direct mail marketing.},

            We perform a comparative analysis of machine learning methods for the canonical problem of empirical asset pricing: measuring asset risk premiums. We demonstrate large economic gains to investors using machine learning forecasts, in some cases doubling the performance of leading regression-based strategies from the literature. We identify the best-performing methods (trees and neural networks) and trace their predictive gains to allowing nonlinear predictor interactions missed by other methods. All methods agree on the same set of dominant predictive signals, a set that includes variations on momentum, liquidity, and volatility.

	abstract = {Using repeated large-scale surveys of U.S. households, we study the cryptocurrency investment decisions and motives of households relative to other financial assets. Cryptocurrency holders tend to be young, white, male and more libertarian relative to non-crypto holders. They expect much higher rates of returns for crypto and perceive it as relatively safer than do other households. They also view it as a better hedge against inflation. For those holding cryptocurrencies, changes in Bitcoin prices translate into their purchases of durable goods. Finally, exogenously-provided information about historical returns of cryptocurrencies leads individuals to increase their desired crypto holdings and makes them more likely to actually purchase cryptocurrency subsequently. We compare these views and behaviors to those of households toward other financial assets and argue that cryptocurrency is unique in many of these respects.},

I do not find evidence of informed trading among these investors. Changes in their holdings also do not resemble random, uncorrelated noise trading. Instead I find that the number of retail investors holding a firm’s shares increases in response to both more positive and more negative earnings news, consistent with attention-driven trade. An intraday analysis suggests these traders do not respond to announced earnings per se but instead to observed market returns. Consistent with this coordinated trading exerting pressure on prices, I find that stock returns drift upward following both the most positive and the most negative earnings surprises when increases in retail holdings are greatest and the firm is relatively small or costly to sell short.},

For stocks priced above \$46, on the other hand, an increase in abnormal search volume leads to more odd lot trading. For a stock priced at \$78 – the mean share price in our sample – a one standard deviation increase of abnormal search volume increases the average share of odd lot trading by 10 basis points. This effect is even stronger for more expensive stocks.

            We identify long-lived pricing errors through a model in which inattentive investors arrive stochastically to trade. The model’s parameters are structurally estimated using daily NYSE market-maker inventories, retail order flows, and prices. The estimated model fits empirical variances, autocorrelations, and cross-autocorrelations among our three data series from daily to monthly frequencies. Pricing errors for the typical NYSE stock have a standard deviation of 3.2 percentage points and a half-life of 6.2 weeks. These pricing errors account for 9.4\${\textbackslash}\%\$, 7.0\${\textbackslash}\%\$, and 4.5\${\textbackslash}\%\$ of the respective daily, monthly, and quarterly idiosyncratic return variances.},

Upper price limit events coincide with initial price increases followed by statistically significant price mean reversion over the following week.

The QMJ premium on Monday is 2.89 times higher than its daily average.

We then extend the TVP-VAR so that its dimension can change over time. For instance, we can have a large TVP-VAR as the forecasting model at some points in time, but a smaller TVPVAR at others. A final extension lies in the development of a new method for estimating, in a time-varying manner, the parameter(s) of the shrinkage priors commonly-used with large VARs. These extensions are operationalized through the use of forgetting factor methods and are, thus, computationally simple. An empirical application involving forecasting inflation, real output and interest rates demonstrates the feasibility and usefulness of our approach.},

At the time of the sales, some policymakers raised concerns that these corporations would ignore safety. Others claimed that the sales would bring improved reactor management, with positive effects on safety. Using data on various safety measures and a difference-in-differences estimation strategy, I find that safety improved following ownership transfers and the removal of price regulations. Generation increased, and this does not appear to have come at the cost of public safety. (JEL D24, L51, L94, L98, Q42, Q48)},

Next, we construct out-of-sample forecasts of stock returns based on a wide range of characteristics using machine learning methods and linear models.

Second, we recast the problem of selecting a portfolio of correlated assets and signals into selecting a set of uncorrelated managed portfolios through the lens of Canonical Correlation Analysis of Hotelling (1936). The new investment environment of uncorrelated managed portfolios offers unique economic insights into the joint correlation structure of our optimal portfolio policy. We also operationalize our theoretical framework to bridge the gap between theory and practice, showcasing the improved performance of our pro­ posed method over natural competing benchmarks.},

This suggests a direct relation between salience and retail investors’ trading decisions: a local store in a small city i) increases the visual salience of the firm for the city residents but ii) does not provide any useful information for day-trading, which depends exclusively on high-frequency indicators. We explore our detailed dataset to control for indirect channels that can make retail day-trading correlate with local stores.},

Our empirical analysis investigates the largest dataset in the high-frequency literature. First, we use all traded stocks from NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ stock markets for 1996–2017 to construct the five Fama–French factors and the momentum factor at the 5-minute frequency. Second, we document the key empirical properties across all the stocks and the new factors, and apply the nonparametric time series regression model with the new high-frequency Fama–French factors. We find that this factor model is effective in explaining the systematic component of the risk of individual stocks.

We then extend the TVP-VAR so that its dimension can change over time. For instance, we can have a large TVP-VAR as the forecasting model at some points in time, but a smaller TVPVAR at others. A final extension lies in the development of a new method for estimating, in a time-varying manner, the parameter(s) of the shrinkage priors commonly-used with large VARs. These extensions are operationalized through the use of forgetting factor methods and are, thus, computationally simple. An empirical application involving forecasting inflation, real output and interest rates demonstrates the feasibility and usefulness of our approach.},

In this article, we consider a general framework for counterfactual analysis for high-dimensional, nonstationary data with either deterministic and/or stochastic trends, which nests well-established methods, such as the synthetic control. We propose a resampling procedure to test intervention effects that does not rely on postintervention asymptotics and that can be used even if there is only a single observation after the intervention.

This framework allows to capture possible changes in the underlying structure of the data in a more ﬂexible and robust manner. Speciﬁcally, there is neither a need to arbitrarily set the rolling-window size nor a loss of observations in the calculation of the dynamic measures of connectedness, as no rolling-window analysis is involved. Given that the proposed framework rests on multivariate Kalman ﬁlters, it is less sensitive to outliers. Furthermore, we emphasise the merits of this approach by conducting Monte Carlo simulations.

Our results demonstrate a limited information transmission of volatility from cryptocurrencies to both traditional and green assets, while the connection of clean cryptocurrencies (CI) with the financial system is even weaker compared to that of dirty cryptocurrencies (DI), especially after the COVID-19 pandemic. In contrast, connection within the financial system is found to be relatively closer. Moreover, causal relationships between economic policy uncertainty (EPU) and cryptocurrency-financial asset linkages are generally enhanced after the pandemic onset, while such the causality of uncertainty with DI related asset linkages tends to be even stronger. Most of the above causalities are shown to be negligible during market depression, further implying the sheltering role of the market linkages against uncertainty.},

            We propose a novel measure of arbitrage activity to examine whether arbitrageurs can have a destabilizing effect on the stock market. We focus on stock price momentum, a classic example of a positive-feedback strategy that our theory predicts can be destabilizing. Our measure, dubbed comomentum, is the high-frequency abnormal return correlation among stocks on which a typical momentum strategy would speculate. When comomentum is low, momentum strategies are stabilizing, reflecting an underreaction phenomenon that arbitrageurs correct. When comomentum is high, the returns on momentum stocks strongly revert, reflecting prior overreaction from crowded momentum trading that pushes prices away from fundamentals.

Standard event study analysis shows no significant adjustment in trading ahead of scheduled macro news announcements and trading contrary to the announcement surprise after the event. A panel regression analysis shows that the contrarian trading behavior is mostly driven by lagged returns rather than fundamental macro news. Further intraday time series analysis shows that the lagged overall news sentiment also significantly affects investor net order flow. Finally, we show that simple cross-over trading strategies that exploit retail investor order flow imbalance are profitable. Overall our results suggest that retail investors in currency markets follow the news and are influenced by news sentiment and past returns, but do not possess the skills to extract fundamental information from public news. Their trading behavior contributes to the slowdown of the price discovery process. Our findings support the differential abilities of market participants to interpret public information as an explanation for the importance of order flow in price formation in currency markets.},

Given a local policy invariance assumption, we further show this TED equals the change in the treatment effect that would result from a marginal change in the threshold, which we call the marginal threshold treatment effect (MTTE). We apply these results to Goodman (2008), who estimates the effect of a scholarship program on college choice. MTTE in this case identiﬁes how this treatment effect would change if the test score threshold to qualify for a scholarship were changed, even though no such change in threshold is actually observed.},

Compared to the existing surveys on the subject, our paper is less technical and speaks to the applied economist with a solid basic understanding of econometric techniques who would like to use MTE estimation. Our framework of analysis is a generalized Roy model based on the potential outcomes framework, within which we deﬁne different treatment effects of interest, and review the well-known case of IV estimation with a discrete instrument resulting in a local average treatment effect (LATE). Turning to IV estimation with a continuous instrument, we demonstrate that the 2SLS estimator may be viewed as a weighted average of LATEs and discuss MTE estimation as an alternative and more informative way of exploiting a continuous instrument. We clarify the assumptions underlying the MTE framework, its relation to the correlated random coefﬁcients model, and illustrate how the MTE estimation is implemented in practice.},

After reviewing some basic concepts, including the deﬁnition of a partially identiﬁed model and the identiﬁed set, we turn our attention to the construction of conﬁdence regions in partially identiﬁed settings. In our discussion, we emphasize the importance of requiring conﬁdence regions to be uniformly consistent in level over relevant classes of distributions. Due to space limitations, our survey is mainly limited to the class of partially identiﬁed models in which the identiﬁed set is characterized by a ﬁnite number of moment inequalities or the closely related class of partially identiﬁed models in which the identiﬁed set is a function of a such a set. The latter class of models most commonly arise when interest focuses on a subvector of a vectorvalued parameter, whose values are limited by a ﬁnite number of moment inequalities. We then rapidly review some important parts of the broader literature on inference in partially identiﬁed models and conclude by providing some thoughts on fruitful directions for future research.},

            Clustered standard errors, with clusters defined by factors such as geography, are widespread in empirical research in economics and many other disciplines. Formally, clustered standard errors adjust for the correlations induced by sampling the outcome variable from a data-generating process with unobserved cluster-level components. However, the standard econometric framework for clustering leaves important questions unanswered: (i) Why do we adjust standard errors for clustering in some ways but not others, for example, by state but not by gender, and in observational studies but not in completely randomized experiments? (ii) Is the clustered variance estimator valid if we observe a large fraction of the clusters in the population? (iii) In what settings does the choice of whether and how to cluster make a difference? We address these and other questions using a novel framework for clustered inference on average treatment effects. In addition to the common sampling component, the new framework incorporates a design component that accounts for the variability induced on the estimator by the treatment assignment mechanism. We show that, when the number of clusters in the sample is a nonnegligible fraction of the number of clusters in the population, conventional clustered standard errors can be severely inflated, and propose new variance estimators that correct for this bias.},

What is the interpretation of the estimated parameters and the standard errors? In practice, researchers typically assume that the sample is randomly drawn from a large population of interest and report standard errors that are designed to capture sampling variation. This is common even in applications where it is difﬁcult to articulate what that population of interest is, and how it differs from the sample. In this article, we explore an alternative approach to inference, which is partly design-based. In a design-based setting, the values of some of the regressors can be manipulated, perhaps through a policy intervention. Design-based uncertainty emanates from lack of knowledge about the values that the regression outcome would have taken under alternative interventions. We derive standard errors that account for design-based uncertainty instead of, or in addition to, sampling-based uncertainty. We show that our standard errors in general are smaller than the usual inﬁnite-population sampling-based standard errors and provide conditions under which they coincide.},

We employ a ADCC model and find that Bitcoin can be an intraday hedge for the CHF, EUR and GBP, but acts as a diversifier for the AUD, CAD and JPY. We also implement the non-temporal Hansen (2000) test to examine the safe haven properties of Bitcoin and find that Bitcoin is a safe haven during periods of extreme market turmoil for the CAD, CHF and GBP. Therefore our results indicate that Bitcoin does act as an intraday hedge, diversifier and safe haven for certain currencies, which will be of great interest to currency, cryptocurrency and high frequency investors alike.},

A branch of literature links the existence of a bubble in some financial asset’s price to strict local martingales — a finitely lived asset has a bubble if, and only if, it is a strict local martingale under the equivalent risk-neutral measure. A diffusion process is a strict local martingale if its volatility increases faster than linearly as its level grows. We apply a nonparametric method to estimate the volatility function of Bitcoin daily and high frequency prices, as well as of more traditional financial assets. We then estimate the stochastic volatility model of Andersen and Piterbarg (2007), whose parameter space has a specific subset under which the asset’s price is a strict local martingale. Results suggest the existence of a bubble in Bitcoin prices from early 2013 to mid 2014, but, interestingly, not in late 2017.},

The results for the entire period provide no evidence of an asymmetric return-volatility relation in the Bitcoin market. We test if there is a difference in the return-volatility relation before and after the price crash of 2013 and show a significant inverse relation between past shocks and volatility before the crash and no significant relation after. This finding shows that, prior to the price crash of December 2013, positive shocks increased the conditional volatility more than negative shocks. This inverted asymmetric reaction of Bitcoin to positive and negative shocks is contrary to what we observe in equities. As leverage effect and volatility feedback don’t adequately explain this reaction, we propose the safe-haven effect (Baur, 2012). We highlight the benefits of adding Bitcoin to a US equity portfolio, especially in the precrash period. Robustness analyses show, among others, a negative relation between the US implied volatility index (VIX) and Bitcoin volatility. Those additional analyses further support our findings and provide useful information for economic actors who are interested in adding Bitcoin to their equity portfolios or are curious about the capabilities of Bitcoin as a financial asset.},

In line with the literature on financial markets, we find that returns are not predictable while volatility is predictable to some extent. We discuss a number of reasons why the predictive power is poor. One aspect is the observational frequency which is therefore varied. The results of unpredictable cryptocurrency returns hold on higher (hourly) and lower (weekly) frequencies. Volatility, in contrast, is predictable on all frequencies and we document an increasing accuracy of the forecast when the sampling frequency is lowered.},

	abstract = {Bitcoin is deﬁned as digital money within a decentralized peer-to-peer payment network. It is a hybrid between ﬁat currency and commodity currency without intrinsic value and independent of any government or monetary authority. This paper analyses the question of whether Bitcoin is a medium of exchange or an asset and more speciﬁcally, what is its current usage and what usage will prevail in the future given its characteristics. We analyse the statistical properties of Bitcoin and ﬁnd that it is uncorrelated with traditional asset classes such as stocks, bonds and commodities both in normal times and in periods of ﬁnancial turmoil. The analysis of transaction data of Bitcoin accounts shows that Bitcoins are mainly used as a speculative investment and not as an alternative currency and medium of exchange.},

We test the presence of long memory in return time series from 2011 to 2017, using transaction data from one Bitcoin platform. We compute the Hurst exponent by means of the Detrended Fluctuation Analysis method, using a sliding window in order to measure long range dependence. We detect that Hurst exponents changes significantly during the first years of existence of Bitcoin, tending to stabilize in recent times. Additionally, multiscale analysis shows a similar behavior of the Hurst exponent, implying a self-similar process.},

The nonparametric characteristics of our test control for misspeciﬁcation due to nonlinearity and structural breaks, two features of our data that cover 19th December 2011 to 25th April 2016. The causality-in-quantiles test reveals that volume can predict returns – except in Bitcoin bear and bull market regimes. This result highlights the importance of modelling nonlinearity and accounting for the tail behaviour when analysing causal relationships between Bitcoin returns and trading volume.

We identify several differences in the behaviour of Bitcoin price returns in the pre- and post-\$1000 sub-periods and evidence of asymmetric reverting patterns in the Bitcoin price returns under all the ANAR models employed, regardless of the data frequency considered. We also present evidence indicating stronger reverting behaviour of negative price returns in terms of both reverting speed and magnitude compared to positive returns and evidence of positive serial correlation with prior positive price returns. Finally, we also investigated asymmetries in Bitcoin price return series' persistence by employing higher order ANAR models, finding evidence of a higher persistence of positive returns than negative returns, a result that further supports the existence of asymmetric reverting behaviour in the Bitcoin price returns.},

We estimate the model using US data on industrial production growth, inflation, interest rates and stock returns. In terms of in-sample fit, the VAR model featuring both stochastic volatility and t-distributed disturbances outperforms restricted alternatives that feature either attributes. The VAR model with t disturbances results in density forecasts for industrial production and stock returns that are superior to alternatives that assume Gaussianity, and this difference is especially stark over the recent Great Recession. Further international evidence confirms that accounting for both stochastic volatility and Student’s t-distributed disturbances may lead to improved forecast accuracy.},

We show that these results could be explained on the basis of increased market uncertainty that is associated with periods of highly volatile prices. In addition, despite the fact that Bitcoin still inﬂuences the cryptocurrency market substantially, we note that, recently, Ethereum has become the number one net transmitting cryptocurrency. We further note that the market gradually becomes more complex considering our connectedness approach and that this might be attributed to the unique characteristics and possibilities inherent in the technology of each cryptocurrency.

To do this, we use Wavelet Coherence (WC), Cross Wavelet Transform (CWT), Power Wavelet Coherence (PWC), and Multiple Wavelet Coherence (MWC) approaches. The results show that the BTC-VIX relationship varies across time and at high and low frequencies. Moreover, we find positive (or in-phase) co-movements between both variables while a negative co-movement (outof-phase) is observed at both high and low frequencies. VIX news has a prediction power on BTC price returns over different frequencies. The results of PWC and MWC show that OVX, EPU, and GPR factors affect the BTC-VIX nexus under different frequencies. Finally, correlations between BTC-uncertainty indices are dependent upon investment horizons.

In contrast to previous research that has demonstrated the disposition effect by aggregating across investors, our main objective is to identify differences in the disposition bias across individuals and explain this in terms of underlying investor characteristics. Building on the findings in experimental economics and social psychology, we hypothesize that differences in investor literacy about financial markets and trading frequency are responsible in part for the variation in individual disposition effect. Using demographic and socioeconomic variables as proxies for investor literacy, we find empirical evidence that wealthier individuals and individuals employed in professional occupations exhibit a lower disposition effect. Consistent with experimental economics, trading frequency also tends to reduce the disposition effect. We provide guidelines for investment advisors, regulators, and investment communities to utilize our findings and help investors make better decisions.},

	abstract = {There is a well-known intuition linking prospect theory with the disposition effect, the tendency of investors to sell assets that have risen in value rather than fallen. Recently, several authors have studied rigorous models in an attempt to formalize the intuition. However, some have found it difficult to predict a disposition effect while others produce a more extreme prediction where investors never voluntarily sell at a loss. We solve a model of asset liquidation where investors realize utility over gains and losses, and utility is concave over gains and convex over losses. Under the preferences of Tversky and Kahneman (Tversky, A., D. Kahneman. 1992. Advances in prospect theory: Cumulative representation of uncertainty. J. Risk Uncertainty 5(4) 297–323) and lognormal asset prices, investors exhibit a disposition effect as gains are realized at a greater rate than losses. Nonetheless, in contrast to the extant literature, we find that the investor will “give up” and sell at a loss when the asset has a sufficiently low Sharpe ratio.

While both types of intermediaries create safe “money-like” claims, they go about this in different ways. Traditional banks create money-like claims by holding illiquid fixed-income assets to maturity, and they rely on deposit insurance and costly equity capital to support this strategy. This strategy allows bank depositors to remain “sleepy”: they do not have to pay attention to transient fluctuations in the market value of bank assets. In contrast, shadow banks create money-like claims by giving their investors an early exit option requiring the rapid liquidation of assets. Thus, traditional banks have a stable source of funding, while shadow banks are subject to runs and fire-sale losses. In equilibrium, traditional banks have a comparative advantage at holding fixed-income assets that have only modest fundamental risk but are illiquid and have substantial transitory price volatility, whereas shadow banks tend to hold relatively liquid assets.},

	abstract = {Prior experimental and empirical research documents that many investors have a lower propensity to sell those stocks on which they have a capital loss. This behavioral phenomenon, known as “the disposition effect,” has implications for equilibrium prices. We investigate the temporal pattern of stock prices in an equilibrium that aggregates the demand functions of both rational and disposition investors. The disposition effect creates a spread between a stock’s fundamental value -- the stock price that would exist in the absence of a disposition effect -- and its market price. Even when a stock’s fundamental value follows a random walk, and thus is unpredictable, its equilibrium price will tend to underreact to information. Spread convergence, arising from the random evolution of fundamental values, generates predictable equilibrium prices. This convergence implies that stocks with large past price runups and stocks on which most investors experienced capital gains have higher expected returns that those that have experienced large declines and capital losses. The profitability of a momentum strategy, which makes use of this spread, depends on the path of past stock prices. Crosssectional empirical tests of the model find that stocks with large aggregate unrealized capital gains tend to have higher expected returns than stocks with large aggregate unrealized capital losses and that this capital gains “overhang” appears to be the key variable that generates the profitability of a momentum strategy. When this capital gains variable is used as a regressor along with past returns and volume to predict future returns, the momentum effect disappears.},

The central idea consists in estimating local projections at each period of interest rather than extrapolating into increasingly distant horizons from a given model, as it is done with vector autoregressions (VAR). The advantages of local projections are numerous: (1) they can be estimated by simple regression techniques with standard regression packages; (2) they are more robust to misspecification; (3) joint or point-wise analytic inference is simple; and (4) they easily accommodate experimentation with highly nonlinear and flexible specifications that may be impractical in a multivariate context. Therefore, these methods are a natural alternative to estimating impulse responses from VARs. Monte Carlo evidence and an application to a simple, closed-economy, new-Keynesian model clarify these numerous advantages.},

            This paper shows that standard disaster risk models are inconsistent with movements in stock market volatility and credit spreads during disasters. We resolve this shortcoming by incorporating persistent macroeconomic crises into a structural credit risk model. The model successfully captures the joint dynamics of aggregate consumption, financial leverage, and asset market risks, both unconditionally and during crises. Leverage strongly amplifies fundamental shocks by continuing to rise while crises endure. We structurally estimate the model and show that it replicates the firm-level implied volatility curve and its cross-sectional relation with observable proxies of default risk.},

            We study the speed with which investors learn about managers’ skills by examining how quickly investor and managers’ beliefs converge. After showing our measure proxies for the change in the dispersion of beliefs, we find that hedge fund investors learn as fast as suggested by Bayes’ rule. However, we find mutual fund investors learn more slowly than suggested by Bayes’ rule. Mutual fund investors’ slow learning is not due to the use of different performance measures, institutional frictions, or lack of sophistication, but could be due to a low payoff from learning. Our results indicate learning speed depends on financial participants’ incentives.

Cryptocurrency holders tend to be young, white, male and more libertarian relative to non-crypto holders. They expect much higher rates of returns for crypto and perceive it as relatively safer than do other households. They also view it as a better hedge against inflation. For those holding cryptocurrencies, changes in Bitcoin prices translate into their purchases of durable goods. Finally, exogenously-provided information about historical returns of cryptocurrencies leads individuals to increase their desired crypto holdings and makes them more likely to actually purchase cryptocurrency subsequently. We compare these views and behaviors to those of households toward other financial assets and argue that cryptocurrency is unique in many of these respects.},

	doi = {10.2139/ssrn.4274617},
	abstract = {Both over- and underreaction to information are well-documented empirically across a variety of domains. This paper explores how key features of the learning environment determine which bias emerges in a given setting. We first develop a two-stage model of belief formation. In the first stage, limited attention leads the agent to use the representativeness heuristic to simplify the learning environment by focusing on a subset of the information structure. The agent then forms subjective beliefs based on a noisy representation of the edited information structure. This model predicts underreaction when the state space is simple, signals are precise, and the prior is flat or diffuse; it predicts overreaction when the state space is complex, signals are noisy, and the prior is concentrated. A series of experiments provide direct support for these theoretical predictions. As a stark example, increasing the complexity of the state space from two to three states completely reverses the direction of the bias from underreaction to overreaction. The results highlight that both stages of belief updating are crucial, in that neither stage on its own can explain the observed patterns in the data. Our framework also rationalizes the disparate findings in prior work: the model predicts the prevalence of underreaction in laboratory studies—which typically use a binary state space, relatively informative signals, and flat priors—as well as the predominance of overreaction documented in financial markets—which feature a more complex state space and noisier signals.},

We study whether corporate spending plans differ conditional on this surveybased measure of ﬁnancial constraint. Our evidence indicates that constrained ﬁrms planned deeper cuts in tech spending, employment, and capital spending. Constrained ﬁrms also burned through more cash, drew more heavily on lines of credit for fear banks would restrict access in the future, and sold more assets to fund their operations. We also ﬁnd that the inability to borrow externally caused many ﬁrms to bypass attractive investment opportunities, with 86\% of constrained U.S. CFOs saying their investment in attractive projects was restricted during the credit crisis of 2008. More than half of the respondents said they canceled or postponed their planned investments. Our results also hold in Europe and Asia, and in many cases are stronger in those economies. Our analysis adds to the portfolio of approaches and knowledge about the impact of credit constraints on real ﬁrm behavior.},

Further, lottery investment levels are higher in regions with favorable lottery environments. Because lottery-type stocks underperform, gambling-related underperformance is greater among low-income investors who excessively overweight lottery-type stocks.

Two principal factors have contributed to this evolution: a body of evidence showing how psychological bias affects the behavior of economic actors; and an accumulation of evidence that is hard to reconcile with fully rational models of security market trading volumes and returns. In particular, asset markets exhibit trading volumes that are high, with individuals and asset managers trading aggressively, even when such trading results in high risk and low net returns. Moreover, asset prices display patterns of predictability that are difficult to reconcile with rational-expectations–based theories of price formation.

We find that higher financial development fosters firm growth, higher labor demand, and higher average wages, especially for cities initially in banking deserts. However, these gains are not shared equally. Instead, they increase with workers’ productivity, implying a substantial increase in wage inequality. The changes to inequality are concentrated in cities where the initial supply of skilled workers is low, indicating that talent scarcity can drive how financial development affects inequality. Our results are inconsistent with alternative explanations such as differential exposure to Brazil's economic boom, an overall increase in government lending, and other government or social welfare programs. These results motivate embedding skill heterogeneity into macro-finance development models in order to capture these distributional consequences.},

When this resale effect is strong, cycles disappear and multiple steady states coexist with different levels of liquidity.

Over the period from 1962 to 1997 there has been a noticeable increase in firm-level volatility relative to market volatility. Accordingly, correlations among individual stocks and the explanatory power of the market model for a typical stock have declined, whereas the number of stocks needed to achieve a given level of diversification has increased. All the volatility measures move together countercyclically and help to predict GDP growth. Market volatility tends to lead the other volatility series. Factors that may be responsible for these findings are suggested.},

As predicted by this theory, we show that banks closely match the interest rate sensitivities of their interest income and expense, and that this insulates their equity from interest rate shocks. Our results explain why banks supply long-term credit.},

            We show that constraints can improve financial decision-making by disciplining behavioral biases. In financial markets, restrictions on leverage limit traders’ ability to borrow to open new positions. We demonstrate that regulation that restricts the provision of leverage to retail traders improves trading performance. By increasing the opportunity cost of postponing the realization of losses, leverage constraints improve traders’ market timing and reduce their disposition effect. We replicate these findings in two distinct experimental settings, further isolating the mechanism and demonstrating generality of the results. The interaction between constraints and behavioral biases has implications for policy and choice architecture.},

The increase in prices has been associated with a decrease in volatility. There is no evidence that changes in margin requirements reduce subsequent stock return volatility. Also, trading halts have not had much effect on volatility in the past.

Second, arbitrage—defined as trading by fully rational investors not subject to such sentiment—is risky and therefore limited. The two assumptions together imply that changes in investor sentiment are not fully countered by arbitrageurs and so affect security returns.

We then contrast these two models with DE (benchmark) in single and multi-period optimizations on a portfolio consisting of ﬁve cryptoassets under the coherent risk measure CVaR constraint. Our analysis shows that the GARCH-DE-t-copula outperforms the DE and GARCH-DE approaches in both single- and multi-period frameworks.

First, principal components analysis reveals a complex daily return generating process. As we examine data in the most recent year, we find that surprisingly more than one principal component appears to explain the cross-sectional variation. Second, similar to hedge fund returns, cryptocurrency returns suffer from the “beta-in-the-tails” hidden risk. Third, we find that predicting cryptocurrency movements with machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms is marginally attractive with variation in predictability power per crypto-currency. Fourth, lower volatile cryptocurrencies are slightly more predictable than more volatile ones. Fifth, evidence exists that efficacy of distinct information sets varies across machine learning algorithms, showing that predictability may be much more complex given a set of machine learning algorithms. Finally, short-term predictability is very tenuous, which suggests that near-term cryptocurrency markets are semi-strong form efficient and therefore, day trading cryptocurrencies may be very challenging.},

To address co-integration in a mix of stationary and non-stationary time series, we use the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model with a bounds test approach in the estimation. Meanwhile, to detect potential structural changes, we estimate our empirical model on two periods separated by the closure of Mt. Gox (one of the largest Bitcoin exchange markets). According to our analysis, in the short term, the Bitcoin exchange rate adjusts to changes in economic fundamentals and market conditions. The long-term Bitcoin exchange rate is more sensitive to economic fundamentals and less sensitive to technological factors after Mt. Gox closed. We also identify a signiﬁcant impact of mining technology and a decreasing signiﬁcance of mining difﬁculty in the Bitcoin exchange price determination.},

By the sixth day, there is a reversal in price behavior and any such gains are expunged. When comparing the bidirectional linkages between returns and transaction activity, it is shown here that the contribution of return shocks to transaction activity is quantitatively larger in magnitude.},

Both measures coincide in suggesting that the Bitcoin futures market dominates the price discovery process. We also find that both prices are driven by a common factor that is given by a weighted combination of the futures and spot market. Finally, we observe that deviations from the equilibrium condition equating the futures and spot log-price have predictive ability for the return on the Bitcoin spot price but not on the futures price.},

The results show that by adding bitcoin, the portfolio performance improves; but this is due more to the increase in returns than in the reduction of volatility. In addition, the improvement is linked to bitcoin's performance in 2013. We conclude that bitcoin may have a role in portfolio diversification even though our analysis confirms bitcoin speculative characteristics.},

Regardless of the sign of returns, the results show that Litecoin and Bitcoin are at the centre of the connected network of returns. This finding implies that return shocks arising from these two cryptocurrencies have the most effect on other cryptocurrencies. Further analysis shows that connectedness via negative returns is largely stronger than via positive ones. Ripple and Ethereum are the top recipients of negative-return shocks, whereas Ethereum and Dash exhibit very weak connectedness via positive returns. Regarding volatility spillovers, Bitcoin is the most influential, followed by Litecoin; Dash exhibits a very weak connectedness, suggesting its utility for hedging and diversification opportunities in the cryptocurrency market. Taken together, results imply that the importance of each cryptocurrency in return and volatility connectedness is not necessarily related to its market size. Further analyses reveal that trading volume and global financial and uncertainty effects as well as the investment-substitution effect are determinants of net directional spillovers. Interestingly, higher gold prices and US uncertainty increase the net directional negative-return spillovers, whereas they do the opposite for net directional positive-return spillovers. Furthermore, gold prices exhibit a negative sign for net directional-volatility spillovers, whereas US uncertainty shows a positive sign. Economic actors interested in the cryptocurrency market can build on our findings when weighing their decisions.},

Using an extreme-value-theory-based method, we evaluate the extreme characteristics of seven representative cryptocurrencies during 08 August 2015–01 August 2017. We find that during the sub-period of 01 August 2016–01 August 2017, there are finite loss boundaries for most of the selected cryptocurrencies, which are similar to the commodities, and different from the stock indices. Meanwhile, we find that left tail correlations are much stronger than right tail correlations among the cryptocurrencies, and tail correlations increased after August 2016, suggesting high and growing systematic extreme risks. We also find that cryptocurrencies to be both left tail independent, and cross tail independent with four selected stock indices, which implies part of the safe-haven function of the cryptocurrencies, indicating their ability to be a great diversifier for the stock market as gold, but not enough to be a tail hedging tool like gold.},

Realised volatility is fairly consistent throughout the day although it is highest during the opening times of the three major global stock markets. Also liquidity is highest during the opening times of the major global exchanges and the markets tend to be illiquid during the early morning.

In this paper, we explore as to whether cryptocurrency returns, as represented by Bitcoin, exhibit similar asymmetric reverting patterns for minutely, hourly, daily and weekly returns between June 2010 and February 2018. We identify several differences in the behaviour of Bitcoin price returns in the pre- and post-\$1000 sub-periods and evidence of asymmetric reverting patterns in the Bitcoin price returns under all the ANAR models employed, regardless of the data frequency considered. We also present evidence indicating stronger reverting behaviour of negative price returns in terms of both reverting speed and magnitude compared to positive returns and evidence of positive serial correlation with prior positive price returns. Finally, we also investigated asymmetries in Bitcoin price return series' persistence by employing higher order ANAR models, finding evidence of a higher persistence of positive returns than negative returns, a result that further supports the existence of asymmetric reverting behaviour in the Bitcoin price returns.},

To show this, we construct a VAR model where the orthogonalised shocks feature Student’s t distribution as well as time-varying variance. We estimate the model using US data on industrial production growth, inflation, interest rates and stock returns. In terms of in-sample fit, the VAR model featuring both stochastic volatility and t-distributed disturbances outperforms restricted alternatives that feature either attributes. The VAR model with t disturbances results in density forecasts for industrial production and stock returns that are superior to alternatives that assume Gaussianity, and this difference is especially stark over the recent Great Recession. Further international evidence confirms that accounting for both stochastic volatility and Student’s t-distributed disturbances may lead to improved forecast accuracy.},

A branch of literature links the existence of a bubble in some financial asset’s price to strict local martingales — a finitely lived asset has a bubble if, and only if, it is a strict local martingale under the equivalent risk-neutral measure. A diffusion process is a strict local martingale if its volatility increases faster than linearly as its level grows. We apply a nonparametric method to estimate the volatility function of Bitcoin daily and high frequency prices, as well as of more traditional financial assets. We then estimate the stochastic volatility model of Andersen and Piterbarg (2007), whose parameter space has a specific subset under which the asset’s price is a strict local martingale. Results suggest the existence of a bubble in Bitcoin prices from early 2013 to mid 2014, but, interestingly, not in late 2017.},

In particular, we detect statistically significant bilateral co-explosive relationships at the 10\% level or better between the following pairs: Bitcoin–Dash, Ethereum–Litecoin, Ethereum–Dash, Ethereum–Monero, and Ripple–Stellar.},

	abstract = {We examine the relation between price returns and volatility changes in the Bitcoin market using a daily database denominated in US dollar. The results for the entire period provide no evidence of an asymmetric return-volatility relation in the Bitcoin market. We test if there is a difference in the return-volatility relation before and after the price crash of 2013 and show a significant inverse relation between past shocks and volatility before the crash and no significant relation after. This finding shows that, prior to the price crash of December 2013, positive shocks increased the conditional volatility more than negative shocks. This inverted asymmetric reaction of Bitcoin to positive and negative shocks is contrary to what we observe in equities. As leverage effect and volatility feedback don’t adequately explain this reaction, we propose the safe-haven effect (Baur, 2012). We highlight the benefits of adding Bitcoin to a US equity portfolio, especially in the precrash period. Robustness analyses show, among others, a negative relation between the US implied volatility index (VIX) and Bitcoin volatility. Those additional analyses further support our findings and provide useful information for economic actors who are interested in adding Bitcoin to their equity portfolios or are curious about the capabilities of Bitcoin as a financial asset.},

As cryptocurrencies are actively traded on a continuous basis and react very fast to new information, we conduct the analysis initially on a daily basis, lifting the data imposed restriction faced by previous research. In line with the literature on financial markets, we find that returns are not predictable while volatility is predictable to some extent. We discuss a number of reasons why the predictive power is poor. One aspect is the observational frequency which is therefore varied. The results of unpredictable cryptocurrency returns hold on higher (hourly) and lower (weekly) frequencies. Volatility, in contrast, is predictable on all frequencies and we document an increasing accuracy of the forecast when the sampling frequency is lowered.},

We find significant evidence of clustering at round numbers, with over 10\% of prices ending with 00 decimals compared to other variations but there is no significant pattern of returns after the round number. We also support the negotiation hypothesis of Harris (1991) by showing that price and volume have a significant positive relationship with price clustering at whole numbers.},

We applied the Granger causality test and a BEKK-MGARCH model to investigate the return and volatility spillovers between Bitcoin and Litecoin during the period 2013–2018. We divided this period by the date of August 1, 2017, on which Bitcoin underwent its initial bifurcation. In general, our empirical results show that return and volatility spillovers run in one direction only, i.e., from Bitcoin to Litecoin, before the bifurcation, with the direction of shock transmission being reversed after the bifurcation. We conclude that bifurcation has markedly weakened the market position and pricing influence of Bitcoin within cryptocurrency markets. Since bifurcation is convenient for nearly any cryptocurrency, it will likely continue to pose a risk to the cryptocurrency market as a whole.},

We consider heavy-tailed GARCH models as well as GAS models based on the score function of the predictive conditional density of the bitcoin returns. We compare out-of-sample 1\%-Value-at-Risk (VaR) forecasts under 45 different specifications using three backtesting procedures. We find that GAS models with heavy-tailed distributions provide the best out-of-sample forecast and goodness-of-fit properties to bitcoin returns and risk modelling. Normally-distributed GARCH models are always outperformed by heavy-tailed GARCH or GAS models. Besides, heavy-tailed GAS models provide the best conditional and unconditional coverage for 1\%-VaR forecasts, illustrating the importance of modelling excess kurtosis for bitcoin returns. Hence, our findings have important implications for risk managers and investors for using bitcoin in optimal hedging or investment strategies.},

Following its development became a difficult task with the success of cryptocurrencies (CCs) other than Bitcoin. For fiat currency markets, the IMF offers the index SDR and, prior to the EUR, the ECU existed, which was an index representing the development of European currencies. Index providers decide on a fixed number of index constituents which will represent the market segment. It is a challenge to fix a number and develop rules for the constituents in view of the market changes. In the frequently changing CC market, this challenge is even more severe. A method relying on the AIC is proposed to quickly react to market changes and therefore enable us to create an index, referred to as CRIX, for the cryptocurrency market. CRIX is chosen by model selection such that it represents the market well to enable each interested party studying economic questions in this market and to invest into the market. The diversified nature of the CC market makes the inclusion of altcoins in the index product critical to improve tracking performance. We have shown that assigning optimal weights to altcoins helps to reduce the tracking errors of a CC portfolio, despite the fact that their market cap is much smaller relative to Bitcoin.

I deﬁne connectivity as the degree of overlap in the set of exchanges two cryptocurrencies trade on. Due to geographical and other restrictions, these exchanges have distinct investor bases. I show that connected currencies exhibit substantial contemporaneous covariation. In addition, currencies connected to those that perform well outperform currencies connected to those that perform poorly by 71 (214) basis points over the next day (week). Evidence from new exchange listings and a quasi-natural experiment exploiting the shutdown of Chinese exchanges shows that the results cannot be explained by endogenous sorting of currencies into exchanges. Using machine learning techniques to analyze social media data, I ﬁnd that the demand effects are 40 to 50\% larger for currencies that rely more heavily on network externalities of user adoption. This ampliﬁed effect is consistent with the notion that demand for a cryptocurrency originates not only from investment motives but also the user adoption that affects the fundamental value of these assets.},

(3) In most cases, both gold and Bitcoin can act as the weak hedge and weak safe-haven against EPU during the extreme bearish and bullish markets, which two can be considered for portfolio diversification during the normal market.},

This paper examines the impact of cryptocurrency issuances on subsequent cryptocurrency returns. It is argued that as Tether is the undisputed ‘stable coin’, the minting of new Tether acts similarly to monetary expansion in cryptocurrency markets, inflating the prices of Bitcoin. We construct a VAR model and show contrary to investor expectations, Tether issuances do not impact subsequent Bitcoin returns, however, they do impact traded volumes. We also document an increase in Tether trading following a subsequent decrease in Bitcoin returns.},

Methods: In this paper, we use monthly data from 2011 to 2016 to build a VEC model to exam how economic factors such as Custom price index, US dollar index, Dow jones industry average, Federal Funds Rate and gold price influence Bitcoin price.
Result: From empirical analysis we find that all these variables do have a long-term influence. US dollar index is the biggest influence on Bitcoin price while gold price influence the least.
Conclusion: From our result, we conclude that for now Bitcoin can be treated as a speculative asset, however, it is far from being a proper credit currency.},

We further analyze structural breaks of market dependences and consider the extent of their influence on such relationships. Our vine-copula results show that the dependences between the three paired markets, WTI-US, WTI-China and US-China, vary dynamically across the six identified structural break periods. In particular, the dependence between WTI-US is stronger and more volatile than that between WTI-China during most of the periods. The dependence between US-China remains at a lower level in the earlier periods, but increases in the final period. Our VAR-BEKK-GARCH results demonstrate distinctive volatility spillovers across these periods, with varying directionality, in response to the structural changes. Overall, our results indicate that the oil market stimulates rapid and continual fluctuations in market dependences, which become manifest most acutely in the aftermath of the Financial Crisis of 2007–08, demonstrating the increasing interdependence between the oil and stock markets. Further, the growing influence of China on the dynamics of these relationships, in the period following the Great Recession, presents evidence that it begins to assume an increasingly important role in global economic recovery.},

We ﬁnd that the dynamic total connectedness across several cryptocurrencies exhibits large dynamic variability ranging between 25\% and 75\%. In particular, periods of high (low) market uncertainty correspond to strong (weak) connectedness. We show that these results could be explained on the basis of increased market uncertainty that is associated with periods of highly volatile prices. In addition, despite the fact that Bitcoin still inﬂuences the cryptocurrency market substantially, we note that, recently, Ethereum has become the number one net transmitting cryptocurrency. We further note that the market gradually becomes more complex considering our connectedness approach and that this might be attributed to the unique characteristics and possibilities inherent in the technology of each cryptocurrency.

To do this, we use Wavelet Coherence (WC), Cross Wavelet Transform (CWT), Power Wavelet Coherence (PWC), and Multiple Wavelet Coherence (MWC) approaches. The results show that the BTC-VIX relationship varies across time and at high and low frequencies. Moreover, we find positive (or in-phase) co-movements between both variables while a negative co-movement (outof-phase) is observed at both high and low frequencies. VIX news has a prediction power on BTC price returns over different frequencies. The results of PWC and MWC show that OVX, EPU, and GPR factors affect the BTC-VIX nexus under different frequencies. Finally, correlations between BTC-uncertainty indices are dependent upon investment horizons.

            We address the determination of bitcoin prices and decentralized security. Users forecast the transactional and resale values of holdings, pricing the risk of systemic attacks. Miners contribute resources to protect against attackers and compete for block rewards. Bitcoin’s design leads to multiple equilibria: the same blockchain technology is consistent with sharply different price and security levels. Bitcoin’s monetary policy can lead to welfare losses and deviations from quantity theory. Price-security feedback amplifies fundamental shocks’ volatility impact and leads to boom and busts unconnected to fundamentals. We characterize how viability versus fiat currency depends on bitcoin’s relative acceptability and inflation protection.},

In contrast to the fiscal response to financial crises, I find no evidence that fiscal space was an important determinant of the aggressiveness of pandemic fiscal packages. Focusing in on the US fiscal policy response, I discuss the policy implications of the unique features of a pandemic recession. I argue that the social insurance and public health components of the \$5.2 trillion US package, such as expanded unemployment insurance and government funding of vaccine development and distribution, were highly appropriate, whereas broad-based stimulus measures, such as the onetime payments to households, were not. Finally, I consider some of the longer-run consequences of the US fiscal policy actions. The aggressive fiscal expansion, along with extensive private saving during the pandemic, is likely to generate rapid growth over the next few years. The rise in the debt-to-GDP ratio, caused by both the policy response and the pandemic recession itself, could limit future fiscal action if anti-debt sentiment reemerges.},

Using a large dataset of approximately 25 million tweets about 23 of the largest cryptocurrencies, I show that investor attention, as proxied by the number of tweets, retweets, and favorites, corresponds to greater cryptocurrency price volatility. I use a Vector Autore­ gression (VAR) framework to show that investor attention predicts future price volatility. Addi­ tionally, days on which investors are “distracted” because of attention-grabbing events correspond to lower price volatility in cryptocurrency markets. The results suggest that increased investor attention to cryptocurrencies has the undesirable effect of increasing price volatility.},

Towards this, we present a model in which there is no representative agent and Ricardian equivalence does not hold because of uncertainty, imperfect credit markets, and nominal rigidities. Targeted lump-sum transfers are expansionary both because of a neoclassical wealth effect and because of a Keynesian aggregate demand effect.},

            Rational models claim “trading to learn” explains widespread excessive speculative trading and challenge behavioral explanations of excessive trading. We argue rational learning models do not explain speculative trading by studying day traders in Taiwan. Consistent with previous studies of learning, unprofitable day traders are more likely than profitable traders to quit. Consistent with models of overconfidence and biased learning (but not with rational learning), the aggregate performance of day traders is negative; 74\% of day trading volume is generated by traders with a history of losses; and 97\% of day traders are likely to lose money in future day trading.

	abstract = {Are market experts prone to heuristics, and if so, do they transfer across closely related domains —buying and selling? We investigate this question using a unique dataset of institutional investors with portfolios averaging \$573 million. A striking finding emerges: while there is clear evidence of skill in buying, selling decisions underperform substantially—even relative to random selling strategies. This holds despite the similarity between the two decisions in frequency, substance and consequences for performance. Evidence suggests that an asymmetric allocation of cognitive resources such as attention can explain the discrepancy: we document a systematic, costly heuristic process when selling but not when buying.},

            We use proprietary brokerage data to study trading patterns within a well-known financial market bubble: the Chinese warrants bubble.

Unskilled investors unprofitably trend-chase and increase holdings in out-of-the-money warrants near expiration, whereas sophisticated investors do the reverse. We find that regulators did not properly forecast trading frenzies, as the prespecified price limits often exclude the fundamental values of warrants.},

            This paper considers the puzzle of increased trading volume around information releases through the lens of canonical models of disagreement. I use a unique data set of clicks on news by key finance professionals to simultaneously measure gradual information diffusion and differences of opinion. I find that neither channel subsumes the other and that the two are complementary in generating trading volume around news events. Their relative strengths depend on the characteristics of the underlying information: gradual information diffusion matters more for straightforward news, while differences of opinion play a larger role around textually ambiguous news.

            This paper exploits hand-collected data on illegal insider trades to provide new evidence on the ability of a host of standard measures of illiquidity to detect informed trading. Controlling for unobserved cross-sectional and time-series variation, sampling bias, and strategic timing of insider trades, I find that when information is short-lived, only absolute order imbalance and effective spread are statistically and economically robust predictors of illegal insider trading. However, when information is long-lasting, insiders strategically time their trades to avoid illiquidity, and none of the standard measures considered are reliable predictors, including bid-ask spreads, order imbalance, Kyle’s λ, and Amihud illiquidity.

We show that a family of causal effect parameters are identified in staggered DiD setups, even if differences in observed characteristics create non-parallel outcome dynamics between groups. Our identification results allow one to use outcome regression, inverse probability weighting, or doubly-robust estimands. We also propose different aggregation schemes that can be used to highlight treatment effect heterogeneity across different dimensions as well as to summarize the overall effect of participating in the treatment. We establish the asymptotic properties of the proposed estimators and prove the validity of a computationally convenient bootstrap procedure to conduct asymptotically valid simultaneous (instead of pointwise) inference. Finally, we illustrate the relevance of our proposed tools by analyzing the effect of the minimum wage on teen employment from 2001–2007.

	abstract = {We use new monthly security-level data on portfolio holdings, ﬂows, and returns of U.S. households to understand asset demand across multiple asset classes. Our data cover a wide range of households across the wealth distribution – including ultra-high-net-worth (UHNW) households – and holdings in many asset classes, including public and private assets. We ﬁrst develop a descriptive model to summarize households’ rebalancing behavior. We ﬁnd that less wealthy households rebalance from liquid risky assets to cash during market downturns, while UHNW households tend to purchase risky assets during those periods and thus stabilize market ﬂuctuations. This pattern is particularly pronounced for U.S. equities. Across risky asset classes, three factors explain most of the variation in portfolio rebalancing and those factors target the long-term equity premium, the credit premium, and the premium on municipal bonds. Next, we develop a new framework to estimate demand curves across asset classes. While nesting traditional models as a special case, our framework allows for a muted response of asset demand to ﬂuctuations in asset prices and easily extends to account for inertia. Our new estimator of asset demand curves exploits variation in second moments of returns and portfolio rebalancing, and can even be used when only a fraction of all holdings in a market can be observed. Our preliminary results indicate that asset demand elasticities are smaller than those implied by standard theories, vary signiﬁcantly across the wealth distribution, and are negative for various groups, pointing to positive feedback trading. In sum, we think that our framework and data paint a coherent picture of U.S. households that captures, quite uniquely, their rebalancing behavior across the wealth distribution and across broad asset classes.},
